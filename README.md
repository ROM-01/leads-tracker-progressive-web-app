# Getting Started

This is a PWA built for my practice.

### What is PWA?
**Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a type of web application that **combines the features of a regular website and a mobile app**. It's built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it offers an experience that feels more like a native app, including the ability to be installed on a device and function offline. 

#### To test out this application:
(Instructions for iPhone)

- From your mobile phone, visit the **official website**: [leads-tracker-ebg.netlify.app]
- Locate and press the **share button icon**, which is normally found at the bottom of screen: ![Alt text](relative%20assets/step1.jpeg "Step 1")
- Scroll down until **"Add to Home Screen"** is in view and click it: ![Alt text](relative%20assets/step2.jpeg "Step 2")
- This will open the panel to give the app a name (The default name is "Leads Tracker"). Click **"Add"** at the top right. Now the application is added to your device. **Thanks for testing!** ![Alt text](relative%20assets/step3.jpeg "Step 3")
